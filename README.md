# quick-snek

Quick Snek was an attempt to while away an afternoon making a fun simple game. I chose to remake the classic snake game.

I wanted to not think while making this, so it's not super efficient or clever.

Things that would be nicer about it:

- rather than iterating over the entire game board to decay old parts of the snake, represent the snake as a single long graphic, like an SVG path
- should probably actually display the score somewhere
- should probably hook up CI/CD
